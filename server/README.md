# Server

The `server` of OldVis image taxonomy labeler.

This server is shared by the web clients in [client-label](../client-label) and [client-compare](../client-compare).

## How to Use

To use the `server`, please follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Setup the Server Resources

#### Step 1.1: Setup images

##### Option 1: Download the image resources

Use [oldvis_dataset](https://github.com/oldvis/oldvis_dataset) to download the image resources and store it to `./static/images/`.

```python
from oldvis_dataset import visualizations, fetch_images
visualizations.download(path="./static/visualizations.json")
fetch_images(metadata_path="./static/visualizations.json", img_dir="./static/images/")
```

> [!WARNING]  
> The image download can be very slow and take days.

##### Option 2: Download a sample of the image resources

A sample of 400 images are available at [oldvis/image-taxonomy](https://github.com/oldvis/image-taxonomy/tree/main/images).

Download these images and store at `./static/images/`.

#### Step 1.2: Setup thumbnails

Unzip `./static/thumbnails.zip` and store the unzipped images at `./static/thumbnails/`.

#### Step 1.3: Setup embeddings

Unzip `./static/embeddings.zip` and store the unzipped `embeddings.jsonl` at `./static/embeddings.jsonl`.

### Step 2: Launch the Server

Before launching the server, make sure you have [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.

To launch the server, you need to:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python server.py
```

If you see the following output, the server is successfully launched ðŸš€.

```bash
 * Serving Flask app 'server'
 ...
```

To verify the server is working and the resources are correctly set up, you can try to access the following URL in your browser: `http://localhost:5001/uuids/7ded1f58-a160-5127-a994-46797eca8e9a/image`.
If you see an image of a chart, the server is working as intended ðŸŽ‰.
